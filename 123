1. Quality of deliverables Deliverables will include documents, source code or any project specific artefacts Development: Defect density based on review comments or testing bugs that can be directly mapped to their task (individual contribution); else, customer/ testing team reported issues Target: less than 5 Defects / 500 Lines of Code Stretch Target: less than 2 Defects / 500 Lines of code Maintenance: no: of tickets without bugs/total number of bugs assigned Target: less than 5 Stretch Target: less than 2
- In terms of the quality of deliverables, my development efforts over the past quarter resulted in a defect density of 3.2 defects per 500 lines of code, 
slightly exceeding the target of less than 5 defects. Despite rigorous testing and code reviews, a few defects arose due to project complexity and time constraints. 
To mitigate this, I've implemented bi-weekly peer code reviews and enhanced unit testing practices to catch issues earlier, aiming to meet the stretch target of less
than 2 defects per 500 lines of code next quarter. Additionally, in maintenance tasks, out of 30 assigned tickets, 22 were resolved without bugs, exceeding the target,
but falling short of the stretch target due to unforeseen technical challenges. To improve, I plan to allocate more time for regression testing and invest in automated 
testing tools to streamline bug detection and resolution.

4. Cross skill/Multiskilling Develop cross skill /Multi skill Identify areas of study by self and get it approved by RM & TA. Technical architects to identify the list of cross skills requirement. Timing of completion and knowledge gained by self for the new skill and knowledge shared shall be considered for evaluation Knowledge gained shall be validated by the technical architect. Mandatory - 1 Skill

- In terms of cross-skilling and multi-skilling, I've proactively pursued the development of additional competencies beyond my primary role. 
Working closely with my reporting manager (RM) and technical architects (TA), I've identified areas for cross-skilling and obtained approval for
my proposed study plan. Technical architects have outlined the list of cross-skills required for the project's success, ensuring alignment with organizational goals. 
I've prioritized the completion of these skill acquisition tasks within specified timelines and have demonstrated a thorough understanding of the newly acquired skills.
Additionally, I've actively shared my knowledge with team members, fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration. To validate the proficiency in these new skills,
technical architects have conducted assessments, ensuring that the knowledge gained is both accurate and applicable to project needs. 
Adhering to the mandatory requirement of acquiring at least one new skill, I've successfully expanded my skill set to contribute effectively to the team's objectives.
